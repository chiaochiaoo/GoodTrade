1. Edit symbol list

To add new symbols, open input.csv and add the desired symbols at the end of the list.

To delete symbols, simply delete the symbols rows. (Please make sure the row is deleted too so there is no empty row between symbols.) 


2. Download 

Run run_me.cmd and the file will be processed and generated a csv file.
